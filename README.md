# Goldilocks

Goldilocks is a DoD-sponsored project developed under UCFâ€™s E4D program, in collaboration with SOUTHCOM, DIU, and a multidisciplinary student team. The project focuses on freshwater conservation in the Panama Canal by simulating fluid-filled bladder systems and modeling their impact on water displacement and transit efficiency.

This repository serves as the hub for all my work related to the Goldilocks project. Linked below are subprojects focused on system simulations, physics modeling, and Panama Canal data analysis.
